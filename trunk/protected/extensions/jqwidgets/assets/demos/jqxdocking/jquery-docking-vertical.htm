                        Before the RISC philosophy became prominent, many computer architects tried to bridge
                        the so called semantic gap, i.e. to design instruction sets that directly supported
                        high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex...</div>

                        A database management system (DBMS) is a software package with computer programs
                        that control the creation, maintenance, and the use of a database. It allows organizations
